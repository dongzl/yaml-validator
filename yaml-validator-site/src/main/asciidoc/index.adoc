Yaml-validator is a data validator based on {yaml-spec-url}[YAML] rules, providing both Kotlin/Java APIs and CLI tools.
It is open-sourced and the source codes are hosted on https://github.com/kezhenxu94/yaml-validator[GitHub].

== Why Yaml-validator

When writing tests, no matter unit tests, integration tests or end to end tests, we have to validate the actual result with the expected result.
It's sometimes painful to compose the expected data and write codes to compare between the actual result and the expected result.
{project-name} simplifies the composition of expected data with YAML, and the comparision with some fluent yet powerful Java/Kotlin APIs.
