=== `!anyOf`, `!any`

Anyone in the **candidate** list matches this rule.

WARNING: It's a common **misunderstanding** that `!anyOf` is a rule list, and if the candidate matches any of the rule, the validation passes.
On the contrary, `!anyOf` means that any item of the candidate list matches this single rule, the validation passes.

==== Example

[source,yaml]
.rules.yaml
----
grades: !anyOf # <1>
  subject: !nn # <2>
  grade: !gt 60 # <3>
----
<1> Any item of the `grades` in the candidate must match this rule.
<2> `subject` must be `not null`.
<3> `grade` must be `greater than 60`.

[source,yaml]
.candidates.yaml
----
grades:
  - subject: ~  # <1>
    grade: 70
  - subject: Chinese # <2>
    grade: 59
  - subject: Math # <3>
    grade: 61
----
<1> This item doesn't match the rule, because `subject` is null.
<2> This item doesn't match the rule, because `grade` is not greater than 60.
<3> This item matches the rule, because `subject` is `not null`, and `grade` is greater than 60.

Thus, the validation passes.
